<sub> if cant see the emojis you should probably update frfr

## What is it?
It's, well, a keychain in the shape of a floppy disc. It has very awesome amazing functions like:
- Being a keychain
- Being a PCB
- Being a PCB (with NFC :0)
- Being **NOT** waterproof (unless you or I make a case)

This is just for the PCB part, if you want to actually also make the keychain part, you'll need some keychain split rings, a keyring, and (if necessary, a normal pair of pliers should do fine) some keychain pliers.
