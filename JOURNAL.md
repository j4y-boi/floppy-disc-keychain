## 10/7/2025 4 PM - Made a sketch, finished schematic.  

Made this sketch:

Then started working on schematic, I fiddled around for around 30 minutes before remembering that Hack Club already has a NFC tutorial and followed a small part of that. Then made some modifications to said schematic and proceeded to begin work on routing PCB.  

## 10/7/2025 5 PM - Made a really crappy v1 of the board  

After managing to get through pcb routing hell, I managed to make this 'lil blueprint (25mmx25mm):

Which after a few small modifications made this preview 3D render of the board.

Currently the hole for the keyring itself is just a via with a 3mm diameter. I'm not sure if this'll work out but I sure hope it will lmao  

## 10/9/2025 - Made a v2 of the board  

First, I improved the v1 of the board by reworking some small parts of the wiring, I also added a button (woah) so that the NFC functionality can be enabled at will so your phone and your keys dont go into a notification war.

Also here's a 3D render of the board:

And the backside's now got this fancy shmancy NFC icon

I'll probably add the back of the floppy disk later.  

## 10/19/2025 - Made a v3 of the board!  

After a few helpful people on Slack pointed out the fact that my traces on the front of the board would affect the range and functionality of the antenna on the back, I was thankful for the fact that it was pointed out and decided to rework parts of the board. After struggling with some wires that refused to connect (check nets if it happens to you), I finally have a v3 of the board!

As you can see in this image, I moved down the antenna and made it a bit smaller so it fit onto the bottom part of the board. I hope that'll reduce interference and make it hopefully work. I also had to move the NFC icon to the corner to make space for the rest of the floppy disk graphics on the back.

While the final board is going to be black, here is a few 3D images of the board in blue so the traces stick out a bit more.

## 10/20/2025 5 PM - Research  

I actually did some research on how to make a keychain and learnt that they are in fact supposed to be connected to a "split ring", which is just a smaller ring. So doing that research I also learnt about the fact I need "special pliers" or something (which is a bit stupid, I looked it up and it was just a pair of pliers but a bit smaller). I could probably live with normal pliers and just buying the rings.

Also, here's the board again, this time in black with a silver finish. I also shrunk the hole and moved it a bit so it'd fit the ring.

## 10/20/2025 10 PM - README and suffering  

SO first, I made a README (wow) here's an image of it, you can also find it on the repo:

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzgwNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b02d0d30eaa10128d7cf402546ba02ce837a1f3d/image.png)

Also I tried making better quality images of the board, but the suffering involved with EasyEDA and KiCAD. That is what made me give up on rendering. The standard 3D images will do for now.  

## 10/21/2025 11:21 PM - Ordered PCB + last minute fixes  

Stupid amazon listings didnt show thickness of the wire of the ring, i had to dig around for one that was similar in size and did note thickness. Had to move the keyringhole (i dont know vocabulary) and make it smaller. Also ordered the PCB, $21.05 for a PCB + Components + Taxes paid is a pretty damn good deal.
