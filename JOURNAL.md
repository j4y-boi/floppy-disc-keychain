## 10/7/2025 2 PM - Made a sketch, finished schematic.  

Made this sketch:

Then started working on schematic, I fiddled around for around 30 minutes before remembering that Hack Club already has a NFC tutorial and followed a small part of that. Then made some modifications to said schematic and proceeded to begin work on routing PCB.  

## 10/7/2025 3 PM - Made a really crappy v1 of the board  

After managing to get through pcb routing hell, I managed to make this 'lil blueprint (25mmx25mm):

Which after a few small modifications made this preview 3D render of the board.

Currently the hole for the keyring itself is just a via with a 3mm diameter. I'm not sure if this'll work out but I sure hope it will lmao
